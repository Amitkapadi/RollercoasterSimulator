RollercoasterSimulator
======================

Android narrow non cardboard vr is not supported yet. I will add support when my gyroscope enabled android device arrives in the mail. 
RollerCoaster Simulator is a mobile phone roller coaster demo with gyroscope camera controls. 
This combines hermite spline collider with a gryoscope camera control srcipt. This is very simple demo right now.
This now has support for google cardboard. When 3d VR is true tilt your phone 90 degrees to navigate and select rollercoasters. 

The spline collider used is here

I'm looking to build the code up and expand it to a create your own roller coaster physics based ride. 

Steps to do that would be.

Create a spline controller that is physics based and procedurally generates a rollercoaster mesh. 

Allow the user to modify the hermite spline points at runtime by draging and pinching.

Allow the user to share tracks with code.


I beilive a mobile game like this would be a very fun interactive game that inspires design and creation. 
The user would be able to add weight and send coasters off single point tracks learning about physics.
