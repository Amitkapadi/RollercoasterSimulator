RollercoasterSimulator
======================
RollerCoaster Simulator is a mobile phone roller coaster demo with gyroscope camera controls. 
This combines hermite spline collider with a gryoscope camera control srcipt. This is very simple demo right now.
I am going to release a version with a couple more coasters on the ios and android stores in the next couple days.

The spline collider used is here

The roller coasters are here

The beast is all rigged up on a scene on my computer but the coaster is to big to upload to git.

I'm looking to build the code up and expand it to a create your own roller coaster physics based ride. 

Steps to do that would be.

Create a spline controller that is physics based and procedurally generates a rollercoaster mesh. 

Allow the user to modify the hermite spline points at runtime by draging and pinching.

Allow the user to share tracks with code.


I beilive a mobile game like this would be a very fun interactive game that inspires design and creation. 
The user would be able to add weight and send coasters off single point tracks.
