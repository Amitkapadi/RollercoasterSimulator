RollercoasterSimulator
======================
RollerCoaster Simulator is a mobile phone roller coaster demo with gyroscope camera controls. 
This combines hermite spline collider with a gryoscope camera control srcipt. This is very simple demo right now.
I am going to release a version with a couple more coasters on the ios and android stores in the next couple days.

I'm looking to build to the code up and expand it to a create your own roller coaster physics based ride.
